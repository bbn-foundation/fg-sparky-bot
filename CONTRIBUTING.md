# Contributing to the bot

Hey welcome! Thanks for helping and contributing to the bot. You don't really
have to do a lot, but there are many things you could do here like updating
the entries, writing bug reports (or fixing them), creating feature requests,
and writing some of your own code that will be added!

There's a few guidelines you should look at that will help and respect the
developers maintaining this bot. As long as you follow through with this,
the maintainers will help you back and treat you nicely.

## Preparations

### Requirements

You should know how to use [git](https://git-scm.com/) and work with the command line since
you will be using that a lot.\
You will also need [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to run and build the bot, as well as to check your code.

## General help/guidance

If you only need help with using or setting up the bot, you can use GitHub's
[discussions](https://github.com/bbn-foundation/fg-sparky-bot/discussions) feature or you can
join the [BBN Foundation's Discord server](https://discord.gg/4nFyfyfdEU).

## Incorrect Entries

If this is someone else's bot instance (aka, the bot's username is not
`FG Sparky Bot#4464` (prod) or `FG Sparky Bot#6017`), you should DM the person that runs that bot.\
Otherwise, you should DM `@skylalights` to fix the entries. Do not make an issue for incorrect entries,
we'd like to keep those only for issues with the bot itself.

## Other Issues

I assume if you reached this point, that means there's a definite issue with the bot itself. Great!

You can [submit an issue](#) to the repository
and fill in the appropriate details. If you know how to fix it, that's even better!
You can [submit a pull request](#submiting-issuespull-requests) with the fix and help improve the bot.

## Submission Guideliens

### Submitting issues

Before you do submit an issue, please check [the existing issues](https://github.com/bbn-foundation/fg-sparky-bot/issues)
to make sure someone didn't

### New entries

Adding new entries should be simple, there's a couple of scripts in the `scripts/` folder that can
generate the boilerplate for you. The only things you will need is:

- The number's name
- A screenshot of the number's symbol ONLY

After that, you can then [make a pull request]()
